# Preliminaries

- This file should be in `STAT240/homework/hw02` on your local computer.
- You should also download `lake-monona-winters-2024.csv` and `lake-mendota-winters-2024.csv` to `STAT240/data` on your local computer.

While you should create your answers in the .Rmd file, homework problems are better formatted and therefore easier to read in the .html file. We recommended frequently knitting and switching between the two as you read and solve problems.

```{r read-data, echo = FALSE}
monona = read_csv("../../data/lake-monona-winters-2024.csv") %>% 
  mutate(ff_cat = case_match(
    ff_cat,
    "X" ~ "Jan 1-15",
    .default = ff_cat
  ), 
  ff_cat = reorder(ff_cat, ff_x))
```

# Problem 1

**Create a histogram** of the `duration` of Lake Monona's closures due to ice. (That is, using the `monona` dataframe created above.)

Incorporate the following customizations:

- **Bars should span neat intervals of ten**; [40, 50], [50, 60], and so on. Make sure they start and end on multiples of 10.

- **Change the outline and inside color** of the bars to some custom combination that you think looks good together.
```{r}
ggplot(monona, aes(x = duration)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "lightblue", color = "blue")
```



# Problem 2

Your friend is trying to produce this plot of frequency counts for the variable `ff_cat`, which captures the date of first freeze in two week periods.

See the file `exampleBarplot.png` in the hw02 folder on Github.

Your friend's attempt below is producing an error.

```{r, error = TRUE}
# Fix your friend's error!
ggplot(monona, aes(x = ff_cat)) +
  geom_bar()
```

**Fix** your friend's error by editing the above chunk (or create another one).

Then, below, **explain** why the original code was wrong and why the fixed code works.

My friend, used geom_col, which need another data set for `y` in aes(), easiest way to fix is using bar plot, it will auto count the frequency. 


# Problem 3

Code in the next chunk makes a scatter plot that shows how the variable `duration` changes with time (using `year1`).

```{r}
# This chunk is provided for you - do not edit
ggplot(monona, aes(x = year1, y = duration)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Lake Monona Winter Closure Durations Over Time",
    subtitle = "Trend Line Shown in Blue"
  )
```

**a)** What does the argument `method = "lm"` change on the plot?

  Make the line straight. 

**b)** What does the argument `se = FALSE` change on the plot?

  Remove the shaded confidence interval.


# Problem 4

This problem refers to the graph created in problem 3 above. Its goal is to display to the viewer that, on average, the duration Lake Monona closes due to ice is decreasing over time.

**a)** In a typical year around 1875, how long would Lake Monona close due to ice? (No code needed - your best guess based on the plot will suffice.) 

  Around 118

**b)** In a typical year around 2000, how long would Lake Monona close due to ice?

  Around 89.

**c)** Consider encountering this graph in a published news paper. Name one specific thing this graph does well to accomplish its goal, and what specific part of the code is responsible for it.

  This graph shows the duration Lake Monona closes due to ice is decreasing over time, which means the cold day is decreasing, average temperate is increasing. The code `geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE)` gives a straight line show the decreasing estimate duration change.

**d)** In the same context as c), name one specific thing that could be improved about this graph, and describe what code you would add/edit to make it happen. (No need to formally write and run the code, just a description.)

  Using `geom_path()` to add another layer to show how the duration is changing from one to next year more clear.  


# Problem 5

The below chunk (which is hidden in the knitted file) reads in `lake-mendota-winters-2024.csv` into a new object called `mendota`.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
mendota = read_csv("../../data/lake-mendota-winters-2024.csv")
```

**Create** a single plot of `duration` versus `year1` (as in problem 3) which has **two smooth curved lines**; a red line for Lake Mendota and a blue line for Lake Monona.
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_smooth(data = mendota, aes(x = year1, y = duration), color = "red", se=FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(data = monona, aes(x = year1, y = duration), color = "blue", se=FALSE)
```


You should accomplish this with one call to `ggplot()` and then two calls to `geom_smooth()`, with one using `monona` and one using `mendota`.


# Problem 6

The below chunk creates a new dataframe called `combined`, which contains freeze durations for both Lake Mendota AND Lake Monona.

```{r}
# We will learn how this code works next week!
combined = bind_rows(monona %>% mutate(lake = "Monona"), mendota %>% mutate(lake = "Mendota")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year1)) %>% 
  select(lake, year1, duration)

# Take a look at the first six rows; notice we have TWO rows for each year now, one for each lake!
head(combined)
```

**Create** a similar plot to the result of problem 5, with `duration` on the y axis, `year1` on the x axis, and two smooth lines, one for each lake. This time, use the `combined` dataset and a single call to `geom_smooth`.

*Hint: You want to `color` the lines by `lake`!*
```{r}
ggplot(combined, aes(x = year1, y = duration,color = lake)) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE)
```


# Problem 7

**Create** a plot which uses **faceting** to separate the trendline of `duration` vs. `year1` (like the previous two questions) into two different panels; one panel for Lake Mendota, one panel for Lake Monona.
```{r}
ggplot(combined, aes(x = year1, y = duration,color = lake)) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(facet = vars(lake))
```


# Problem 8

Compare the resulting graphs from problems 5, 6, and 7.

Consider trying to determine in what time period Lake Mendota was freezing, on average, longer than Lake Monona.

**Which of the three graphs** do you prefer for this determination and why?

  graph at problem 6. Because the freezing time line is combine in one graph, we can easily see which average freezing time is higher than the other. Also, at right side of graph, it show which line represent Mendota and Monona by different color.
